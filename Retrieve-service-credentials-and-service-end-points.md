# Retrieving service endpoints
{: #retrieve-endpoints}

The service endpoints that the cluster exposes are made available to you as `service keys` (aka service credentials).

You can fetch the service endpoints by:
* [Using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI](#obtaining-the-service-endpoints-using-the-ibm-cloud-cli)
* [Using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} REST API](#obtaining-the-service-endpoints-using-the-ibm-cloud-rest-api)
* [From the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console](#obtaining-the-service-endpoints-from-the-ibm-cloud-console)

The service endpoints do not expose the instance credentials. To get the instance credentials, see [Retrieving cluster credentials](/docs/services/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-retrieve-cluster-credentials).

## Obtaining the service endpoints using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI

You need to create a service key for the {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} service instance to obtain the service endpoints.

To create a service key, enter the following command:

```
ibmcloud resource service-key-create <your_service_key_name> <role> --instance-name <your_service_instance_name>
```
where:
- `<your_service_instance_name>` is the name of the service instance you  specified when creating the cluster. You can use `ibmcloud resource service-instances` to find all your service instance names.
- `<your_service_key_name>` is any name that you want to refer your key as. This name is used to retrieve service keys.  
- `<role>` is the role you assigned to the IAM API key which was generated for the service credentials. You will be able to perform only those operations that are permitted for the chosen role. For more details on the roles required to perform an operation, refer to section *Required IAM permissions* in  [Granting permissions to users](/docs/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-grant-permissions).

Expected response:

```
Creating service key <service_key_name> in resource group default of account <your account name> as <your user name>...
OK
Service key <service key crn> was created.
<service key value ….>

```

You can also view your service key by using the following command:

```
ibmcloud resource service-key <service_key_name>
```
where:

- `<service key name>` is the name of the service key that you entered when creating the key.

Sample Response:
Bear in mind that the cluster credentials are not returned in the response.

    "instance_id": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  }
}
```

where `<region>` is the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} hosting location, for example `us-south`.

In the sample response, the properties under `cluster` specify the  cluster service endpoints. No service credentials are returned.

The property `apikey` contains an IAM API key that can be used to generate IAM bearer tokens. An IAM bearer token must be provided for authorization when invoking the service management API URL.

## Obtaining the service endpoints using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} REST API

**Prerequisite**: You need an IAM bearer token. For more information, see [Retrieving IAM access tokens](/docs/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-retrieve-iam-token).

The API endpoint that handles API service keys is `https://resource-controller.cloud.ibm.com/v1/resource_keys`.


To create a resource key, enter:
```sh
curl -X POST \
  https://resource-controller.cloud.ibm.com/v1/resource_keys \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer <IAM bearer token>' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"<key name>","source_crn":"<service instance crn>", "parameters":{"role_crn":"<crn of access role>"} }'
```

where `<region>` is the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} hosting location, for example `us-south`. No service credentials are returned.

## Obtaining the service endpoints from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console

If you follow the steps in this section to get the service endpoints using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, you are directed to the service credentials page for your service instance where you expect to see user credentials. You will notice however that the service credentials are not exposed on this page, only the service endpoints.     

To create a service key from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console:
1. Select the provisioned service instance.
2. Click **Service credentials** in the left side bar.
3. Then click **New credential** to create a new service credential.
4. Enter a name, add configuration parameters (if any) and click **Add**.

The newly created endpoints are listed on this page. Click **View Credentials** to see the details.
