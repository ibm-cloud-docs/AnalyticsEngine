# Accessing objects in {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}
{: #access-objs-in-cos-serverless}

After you have configured {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} to work with {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}, you can start accessing objects in {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} from Spark.

When running Spark jobs, the system is configured to use IBMâ€™s open source Stocator libraries that offer better performance and optimization for large object reads and writes as compared to the default AWS connectors. See  [Stocator - Storage Connector for Apache Spark](https://github.com/CODAIT/stocator){: external}.

To access data objects in an {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} bucket, use the following URI:
```
cos://<bucket_name>.<servicename>/<object_name>
```
where `<bucket>` is the {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} bucket name, for example `b1` and <service> identifies configuration group entry, for example `myObjectStorageInstance`.

For example:
```
cos://b1.myObjcetStorageInstance/detail.txt
```
