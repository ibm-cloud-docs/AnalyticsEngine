# Cloud service endpoints integration
{: #service-endpoint-integration}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} provides connectivity options for accessing cloud services in a secure manner using service endpoints. See [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service endpoints](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint).  

When you provision an {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} instance, you can choose if you want to access your {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} service through the public internet, which is the default setting, or over the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} private network.

## Public network endpoints
{: #public-endpoints}

Public network endpoints provide connections to your {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} Apache Spark and Hadoop clusters on the public network. Your environment needs to have internet access to connect to the clusters.

## Private network endpoints
{: #private-endpoints}

Private network endpoints provide connections to your {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} service over the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} private network. After you have configured your {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} service to use private endpoints, it is not accessible from the public internet.

## Using {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service endpoints
{: #use-service-endpoints}

If you want to enable private network endpoints on your clusters, you need to [enable your account for using {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service endpoints using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint&interface=cli#service-endpoint-cli), and then provision a {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} service instance with private endpoints.

## Provisioning with service endpoints
{: #provision-with-endpoints}

You can provision an {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} service instance with service endpoints by using one of the following methods:

- {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} UI

    To configure the endpoints of your {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} service instance, use the **Endpoints** field on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog page. Select to configure either a **Public** or **Private** network.

    ![Shows the types of endpoints you can select.](images/service-endpoints.png)

- {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI

    If you provision an {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} service instance by using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI,  use the command-line option `service-endpoints` to configure the {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} endpoints. You can specify the value `public` or `private`:
    ```sh
    ibmcloud resource service-instance-create <service instance name> ibmanalyticsengine <plan_name> <region> -p @<path_to_JSON_file_with_cluster_parameters> --service-endpoints <private/public>
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Note that `public` is the default value.

    For more information on provisioning using CLI, see [Provisioning an {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} service instance using the IBM Cloud CLI](/docs/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-provisioning-IAE#creating-a-service-instance-using-the-ibm-cloud-command-line-interface).

- If you provision an {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} service instance by using the Resource Controller API, specify the service-endpoints in the `parameters` section of the request payload.
    ```json
    {
      "name": "<instance name>",
      "resource_plan_id": "<plan id>",
      "resource_group_id": "<resource group id>",
      "region_id": "<region id>",
      "parameters": {
          "hardware_config": "default",
          "num_compute_nodes": "1",
          "software_package": "ae-1.2-hive-spark",
          "service-endpoints": "<private/public>"
        }    
    }
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    For more information on provisioning using REST API, see [Provisioning an {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} service instance using API](/docs/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-provisioning-IAE#creating-a-service-instance-using-the-resource-controller-rest-api).


    Note that you can enable either public or private network endpoints for your {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} instance, not both. You can't change this after the {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} instance was provisioned.

## Service credentials
{: #service-creds}

The service credentials of your {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} service instance will include the service endpoints of the type that you specified when you provisioned the service instance.

Here are some examples of endpoints:

- Private endpoint for accessing the cluster Ambari UI:
    ```text
    https://chs-xti-716-mn001.private.us-south.ae.appdomain.cloud:9443
    ```
- Livy private endpoint for submitting Spark jobs on the cluster:
    ```text
    https://chs-xti-716-mn001.private.us-south.ae.appdomain.cloud:8443/gateway/default/livy/v1/batches
    ```
- You can also use the private endpoint to access the cluster management APIs. For example:
    ```text
    https://api.private.us-south.ae.cloud.ibm.com/v2/analytics_engines/118df864-5041-4770-87f7-3228df1915f3
    ```

## Accessing a cluster by using an allowlist
{: #cluster-access}

You can use an allowlist to approve user access to and from  {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} clusters. See [Using an allowlist to control network traffic](/docs/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-allowlist-to-cluster-access).
