Before you can retrieve the service instance ID, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
- You must have a valid IBMid.
- You must have installed the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI.

To retrieve the service instance ID:

    ```
    ibmcloud api https://cloud.ibm.com
    ibmcloud login <enter your credentials>
    ```
    If you share an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account, you'll be asked to choose an account for the current session.
2. List all service instances:

    ```
    ibmcloud resource service-instances
    ```

    Sample response:
