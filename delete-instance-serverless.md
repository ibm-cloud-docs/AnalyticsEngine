# Deleting a service instance
{: #delete-service}

To delete an {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} service instance, you must have the following [user permissions](/docs/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-grant-permissions).

You can delete a service instance by using one of the following methods:

- The [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} user interface](#ibm-cloud-user-interface)
- The [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI](#ibm-cloud-cli)
- The [Resource Controller REST API](#resource-controller-rest-api)

The underlying cluster is deleted when the service instance is deleted. All data and metadata, including all logs, on the cluster will be lost after the cluster is deleted.

**Important**: {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} service instances, which were created before June 06 2018 in the Cloud Foundry organization and space, can be deleted only by using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} user interface, the cf CLI, or the cf REST API.
