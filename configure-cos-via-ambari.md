# Configure a Cloud Object Storage connection through Ambari
{: #config-cos-ambari}

You can configure the cluster to access data objects in IBM Cloud Object Storage by using the Ambari UI. In Ambari, you can add  properties and values to the core-site.xml file on your cluster instance.

1. Open the Ambari console, and then, on the dashboard, click **HDFS** > **Configs** > **Advanced** to see the advanced configuration options for  HDFS.<br>
