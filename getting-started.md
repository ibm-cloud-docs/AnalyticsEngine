# Getting started tutorial
{: #getting-started}

{{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} provides a flexible framework to develop and deploy analytics applications in Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark. It allows you to create and manage clusters using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} interface, the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} CLI and REST APIs.

## Before you begin

* Get a quick overview of {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} in this short [video](https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/docs/analytics-engine/).

## Provision an instance and create a cluster
* Watch how to [get started using {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}}](https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/docs/analytics-engine/get-started/).

  In this video you will learn how to provision an {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} cluster from IBM Cloud, find out about options to manage the cluster, and see how to connect {{site.data.keyword.DSX_short}} to {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} to analyze data.

 For details about the supported plans and on how to provision and configure your cluster, see the [{{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} documentation](/docs/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-provisioning-IAE).

* Watch how to [provision an {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} service instance through {{site.data.keyword.DSX_short}}](https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/docs/analytics-engine/get-started/#provision).

## Run applications on the cluster

* Watch a [demo](https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/docs/analytics-engine/get-started/#spark-notebook) and run through the tutorial using sample code and data. Copy or download this [notebook](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/exchange/public/entry/view/e2e70feb00a65760eb1bd683da285364) from the {{site.data.keyword.DSX_short}} community to try it for yourself!
* Learn how to use [spark-submit](https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/docs/analytics-engine/get-started/#spark-submit) to execute a Python script on an {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} cluster.
* Learn how to programmatically use {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} through this [tutorial](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/IBM-Analytics-Engine). Get access to sample scripts to start operationalizing your first applications.
* Get answers to some [frequently asked questions](/docs/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-general-faqs) about using {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}}.

## Next steps
{: #getting-started-next-steps}

Now that you have provisioned a service instance and have created a cluster, you can start running jobs and managing your cluster:

- [Run Hadoop MapReduce jobs](/docs/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-run-hadoop-jobs).
- [Run Spark Interactive jobs](/docs/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-spark-interactive).
- [Run Spark Batch jobs](/docs/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-livy-api).
- Manage your cluster by [using the CLI](/docs/cli?topic=analytics-engine-cli-plugin-CLI_analytics_engine#CLI_analytics_engine) for various operations.
